# Feed

API resource representing a container or grouping for a set of runtime ChRIS objects 
known as [plugin instances](plugininstance.md) that are organized as nodes of a 
connected acyclic directed graph (DAG). It can also be viewed as a container for all the 
files generated by the plugin instances run within the feed.

A feed is created by the root node of its plugin instance DAG. The root node must be a 
plugin instance of a [plugin](plugin.md) of type `fs` (feed synthesis plugin). 
The rest of the plugin instances within the feed can only be of type DS (data synthesis, 
by far the most common) or TS (a special type of topological plugin instances).
