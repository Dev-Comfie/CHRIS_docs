# Feed

A feed can be view as a container or grouping for a set of runtime ChRIS objects known as
[plugin instances](plugininstance.md) that are organized as nodes of a connected acyclic 
directed graph (DAG). It can also be viewed as a container for all the files generated by
the plugin instances run within the feed.

A feed is created by the root node of its plugin instance DAG. The root node must be a 
plugin instance associated for a [plugin](plugin.md) of type FS (feed synthesis plugin). 
The rest of the plugin instances within the feed can only be of type DS (data synthesis, 
by far the most common) or TS (a special type of topological plugin instances).
