Instantiating a Local ChRIS instance on WSL
-------------------------------------------

This is a step-by-step guide on instantiating a local ChRIS instance on a Windows Host using WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux 2)

Enabling and/or installing WSL and a Linux distribution
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


* Follow the *Manual Installation Steps* from the https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10#manual-installation-steps[Windows Subsystem for Linux Installation Guide for Windows 10^]  

* At the end of Step 6 in the link above, you should have your choice of Linux distribution installed and configured with WSL.



Installing docker and docker-compose (on the terminal) on Ubuntu on WSL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here's the list of commands in the specified order to be run on the terminal - 

. Installing `docker`

    * Follow the *Install using the repository* steps from the https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/[Install Docker Engine on Ubuntu guide^]
    
    * Docker Engine is installed and running. The `docker` group is created but no users are added to it. You need to use `sudo` to run Docker commands. Continue to https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/linux-postinstall/[Linux postinstall^] to allow non-privileged users to run Docker commands and for other optional configuration steps.

. Installing `docker-compose`

    * Follow the *Install Compose on Linux systems* steps from the https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose-on-linux-systems[Install Docker Compose Guide^]


Instantiating a local ChRIS instance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Once you have `docker` and `docker-compose installed`, open a new terminal window and run `sudo dockerd`
    - `dockerd` is the daemon service for docker containers

* Instantiating CUBE
    - Once you have `dockerd` running, open a new terminal window and follow the steps in the https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_ultron_backEnd/blob/master/README.md[ChRIS Ultron Backend ReadME^] to instatiate an instance of the ChRIS backend services

    - Once the system is "up", you can add more compute plugins to the ecosystem by running:
    `./postscript.sh`

* Instatiating the ChRIS UI 
    - Once you have CUBE running, open a new terminal window and follow the steps in the https://github.com/FNNDSC/ChRIS_ui[ChRIS UI ReadME^]
